# QA-test
1.Write a code to print your name in any language
<html>
<head>
<title>This is my name</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Le Ba Bao Duy</p>

</body>
</html>

2.Write a code to sum up the first 1000 numbers. You can use any language.
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        int i = 1;
        while (i <=1000)
        { 
                sum = sum + i;
                i++;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}

3.Write about 100 words why do you want to learn coding and automation test (in English). 
As a manual QA, I have to test many bug tickets that developers make their fixs on some parts of the system. Therefore, I want to learn coding in order to have ability to understand what changes that the developers make in their commits. If I can do that, I will focus on testing these parts or discover any mistake that the developers can make. For automation test, I can reduce my time and efforts while doing similar tasks (for example: regression test, smoke test...) by making them  automatic.

4.Create a website
